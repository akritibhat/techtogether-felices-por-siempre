The U.S. government lost a track of 1475 immigrant children put in their custody. While trying to solve this issue, the team decided to expand the data parameters to include all children separated from their parents due to extreme circumstances like natural disasters, migration (or refuge), human trafficking.

The children who are lost, are of very young age and don't really remember their place of origin, date of birth to fill these forms. We aim to create a platform which asks the kids and their parents to enter unique things they remember about their family members, like tattoos, height, favourite tv show .... and our matching algorithm takes these parameters to uniquely identify the families.

Having so many features, created an issue of open-ended data points. To solve this issue, we are providing the users with the flexibility to enter as many features as they want, and not limiting the data points and applying Elastic Search on these data points to match profiles.
